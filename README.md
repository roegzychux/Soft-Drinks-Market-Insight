# Soft Drink Market Insight

A comprehensive Excel data analysis project focused on market availability, product visibility, and stock health within the soft drink industry. This project transforms raw field data into an interactive dashboard, helping stakeholders understand brand dominance, channel performance, and merchandising effectiveness.

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end analysis workflow using Microsoft Excel.
The goal was to audit the "Market Pulse" of the soft drink landscape (specifically focused on the Lagos West region). It breaks down key metrics like product availability, storage conditions, and outlet distribution to identify which brands are winning at the shelf and where stock gaps exist.

## Features
- **Executive Overview:** A high-level summary of the market universe, featuring KPIs for Total Outlets, Dominant Brand, and Overall Stock Health.
- **Brand Availability Leaderboard:** A clear ranking of top soft drink brands (e.g., Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Fanta) based on their presence in outlets.
- **Channel Performance Analysis:** Deep dive into how different outlet types (Shops, Kiosks, Supermarkets) are performing.
- **Interactive Slicers:** Dynamic filtering capabilities allowing users to drill down by Brand, Outlet Type, and Packaging.
- **Geospatial Visualization:** An integrated map view tracking regional coverage and outlet locations.
- **Actionable Lists:** A "Priority Action List" table that pinpoints specific outlets with "Partially Stocked" or "Out of Stock" status.

## Tools and Skills Demonstrated
- **Microsoft Excel** (Advanced Formulas, Pivot Tables, Charts)
- **Data Cleaning** (Power Query / Data Transformation)
- **Dashboard Design** (Slicers, Timeline, Dynamic Layouts)
- **Data Visualization** (Custom Charts, Geospatial Mapping in Excel)
- **Business Intelligence Strategy** (Defining and tracking availability & visibility KPIs)

## Key Insights
- **Brand Dominance:** Coca-Cola leads the market in availability (69.4%), followed closely by Pepsi (65.7%).
- **Packaging Preferences:** The market is overwhelmingly dominated by **PET Bottles (91%)**, with Cans accounting for less than 5% of the mix.
- **Outlet Composition:** "Shops" make up the vast majority (87%) of the retail universe, far outnumbering Kiosks and Supermarkets.
- **Infrastructure:** The most common form of merchandising is the "Display Stand," significantly outpacing refrigerators/coolers.
- **Stock Health:** The overall market maintains a robust **83.87% Stock Health** score, though specific outlets identified in the "Priority Action List" require restocking.
